# 🏋️‍♂️ BodyPerformance Analysis Project

## 📜 Project Description
This project focuses on analyzing the **BodyPerformance** dataset and building machine learning models to predict physical performance levels (A, B, C, D) based on physiological and fitness metrics.  
The project covers the complete workflow: understanding and cleaning the data, preprocessing, model building, hyperparameter tuning, and evaluation.
